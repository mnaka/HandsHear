### The Library Folder

The library folder is where you need to add your Leap SDK libraries so that HandsHear can use them. After downloading the Leap SDK you'll find all of the relevant libraries in the *lib* folder, copy them into this folder before using HandsHear.

For example, if you downloaded the linux SDK you'll need to copy the follow files here:

-Leap.py
-LeapPython.so
-libLeap.so
